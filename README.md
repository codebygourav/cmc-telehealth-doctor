# Telehealth Deploymeta PWA (Doctor Dashboard)

A Progressive Web App for doctors working with Telehealth Deploymeta, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your system.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop).

## Getting Started with Docker

You can easily run the production build of this project locally without installing Node.js by using Docker.

### 1. Project Setup

Ensure you have the project files on your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cmc-telehealth-pwa-doctor
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory. This is required by `docker-compose.yml` to pass configuration variables into the container. Follow the .env.sample file to create your .env file.

### 3. Build and Start the Container

Use Docker Compose to build the image and run the container in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

_This command uses the `Dockerfile` to install dependencies, build the optimized Next.js app, and start the application server._

### 4. Access the Application

Once the container is up and running, open your web browser and navigate to:
**[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**

_(Note: The Docker configuration maps the exposed Next.js server to port `8000` on your host machine)._

### 5. Managing the Container

To view logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

To stop and remove the running container:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Local Development (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the application for active development without Docker:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
